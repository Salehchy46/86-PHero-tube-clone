    <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-5">1. Discuss the scope of var, let, and const.</h3>
    <p class="mt-5">The scope of a variable in JavaScript defines where it can be accessed or used within a program. The keywords var, let, and const define variables, but they behave differently in terms of scope, hoisting, and reassignment.</p>
    <p class="mt-5">1. var Scope</p>
      <p>Function Scope: Variables declared with var are scoped to the function they are declared in. If var is declared outside of any function, it becomes global.</p>
      <p>No Block Scope: var does not recognize block scope (e.g., within an if or for block), meaning it "leaks" out of the block and remains accessible in the outer scope.</p>
    <p class="mt-5">2. let Scope</p>
      <p>Block Scope: let variables are scoped to the block in which they are defined. They cannot be accessed outside the block.</p>
      <p>No Hoisting Before Initialization: Unlike var, let variables are not accessible before they are declared (temporal dead zone).</p>
    <p class="mt-5">3. const Scope</p>
      <p>Block Scope: Like let, const is block-scoped.</p>
      <p>Constant Value: const is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned (though their contents may still be mutable if they are objects or arrays).</p>
      <p>No Hoisting Before Initialization: Similar to let, const variables are not accessible before declaration (temporal dead zone).</p>

    <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-5">2. Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h3>
    <p class="mt-5">1. A variable is undefined when it is declared but has not been assigned a value, or when a function does not explicitly return a value.</p>
    <p class="mt-5">The undefined value can be</p>
    <ul class="mt-5">
      <li class="list-disc">Uninitialized Variables</li>
      <li class="list-disc">Function Parameters Without Arguments</li>
      <li class="list-disc">Functions Without a Return Statement</li>
      <li class="list-disc">Accessing Non-Existent Object Properties</li>
      <li class="list-disc">Array Elements with "Holes"</li>
    </ul>
  <p class="mt-5">2. Null is an intentional assignment to indicate the absence of any object or value.</p>
  <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-5">3. What do you mean by REST API?</h3>
  <p class="mt-5">A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a widely used architectural style for designing networked applications. It allows systems to communicate over the internet using a set of standard principles and protocols, primarily HTTP. REST APIs enable developers to build web services that are lightweight, scalable, and maintainable.</p>
